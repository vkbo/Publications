	abstract = {We investigate beam loading and emittance preservation for a high-charge electron beam being accelerated in quasilinear plasma wakefields driven by a short proton beam. The structure of the studied wakefields are similar to those of a long, modulated proton beam, such as the AWAKE proton driver. We show that by properly choosing the electron beam parameters and exploiting two well known effects, beam loading of the wakefield and full blow out of plasma electrons by the accelerated beam, the electron beam can gain large amounts of energy with a narrow final energy spread (\%-level) and without significant emittance growth.},

It is a proof-of-principle R\&amp;D experiment at CERN and the world׳s first proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration experiment. The AWAKE experiment will be installed in the former CNGS facility and uses the 400 GeV/c proton beam bunches from the SPS. The first experiments will focus on the self-modulation instability of the long (rms {\textasciitilde}12 cm) proton bunch in the plasma. These experiments are planned for the end of 2016. Later, in 2017/2018, low energy ({\textasciitilde}15 MeV) electrons will be externally injected into the sample wakefields and be accelerated beyond 1 GeV. The main goals of the experiment will be summarized. A summary of the AWAKE design and construction status will be presented.},

We start with an introduction to plasma wakefield acceleration and the motivation for using proton drivers. We then describe the self-modulation instability – a key to an early realization of the concept. This is then followed by the historical development of the experimental design, where the critical issues that arose and their solutions are described. We conclude with the design of the experiment as it is being realized at CERN and some words on the future outlook.

	abstract = {Plasma wakefield accelerators promise to deliver orders of magnitude higher accelerating gradients than conventional accelerator technology. Whether the technology is used for even higher energy accelerators than exist today, or more compact accelerators, the promise of high gradients has sparked a number of plasma wakefield experiments over the last few decades. The Advanced Wakefield Experiment (AWAKE) is the first to exploit the self-modulation instability in long particle bunches in plasma in combination with a proton bunch from an existing high energy synchrotron. The experiment is located at CERN and connected to the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The first run of AWAKE saw electrons accelerated from 19 mega-electronvolts (MeV) to 2 giga-electronvolts (GeV) in just 10 metres of ionised Rubidium vapour, achieving a gradient of nearly 200 MV/m. A challenge facing plasma wakefield accelerator designs is the final quality of the accelerated bunch in terms of its spread in energy and its emittance. In order to minimise both these parameters while retaining a high accelerating gradient – goals that are to an extent in conflict – the electron bunch needs to load the generated fields in such a manner that it is as uniform as possible over the length of the bunch. Computer simulations are needed to pinpoint the parameters that balance these opposing goals. Part of the work included integration of the experiment into the control system at CERN. However, most of the work presented in this thesis seeks, through computer simulations, to inform design choices for the next run of AWAKE, scheduled to start in 2021. The simulations show that it is, under otherwise ideal conditions, possible to accelerate 30 to 70 pico-Coulomb (pC) of electrons in an accelerator like AWAKE up to 1.8 to 2 GeV in a 4 metre plasma stage, with an energy spread of less than 2 percent and no significant emittance growth. Low energy spread is achieved by finely tuning the witness bunch size and density to fit the plasma parameters as well as the wakefields generated by the drive bunch. Low emittance growth is achieved by exploiting the wake generated by the head of the witness bunch to create a stable condition for the tail of the bunch},

We show that these wakefields periodically defocus the proton bunch itself, consistently with the development of the seeded self-modulation process. We show that the defocusing increases both along the bunch and along the plasma by using time resolved and time-integrated measurements of the proton bunch transverse distribution. We evaluate the transverse wakefield amplitudes and show that they exceed their seed value ({\textless}15 MV/m) and reach over 300 MV/m. All these results confirm the development of the seeded self-modulation process, a necessary condition for external injection of low energy and acceleration of electrons to multi-GeV energy levels.},

The bunch exits the plasma with a periodic density modulation resulting from radial wakefield effects. We show that the modulation is seeded by a relativistic ionization front created using an intense laser pulse copropagating with the proton bunch. The modulation extends over the length of the proton bunch following the seed point. By varying the plasma density over one order of magnitude, we show that the modulation frequency scales with the expected dependence on the plasma density, i.e., it is equal to the plasma frequency, as expected from theory.},
